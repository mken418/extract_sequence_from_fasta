The script, get_coords.py, can be used to extract sequences out of a fasta file given coodinates.
The script takes in two files:
	1) A fasta file of contigs, or chromosomes. NOTE: Each contig/chromosome must only be named numerically. Ex: ">1"
		- NOTE: Each contig/chromosome must only be named numerically. Ex: ">1"
		- ex: >1
		      AGGGTAGCGTAGC...
		      >2
		      GGCTACTTA....
		- NOTE: Most fasta files are fomatted with many seqeunces for the same contig/chromosome on different lines, as such:
			ex: >1
			    AGTGCGTTTGCAT
			    TTGACGTGCGTGT
			    TTGC...
			    >2
			    GGTAGTGCAGTGC
			    GTGACCGT...
			- this is no problem for the script, it will run regardless whether sequences exist on the same line or multiple lines
	
	2) A file containing the coordinates that you would like to extract. These should be in the format of: chromsome/contig#:seq-seq, with one coordinate per line
		- ex: 1:45-100
		      2:9809-1004
		    ... 

Required command line options:
-fa (fasta file that you want to extract the sequence out of)
-coords (file containing coordinates to be extracted)
-out (name of file for script output, the output will be in fasta format)

Future Updates:
	- allow differently labelled contigs
	- provide option for users to use the script for converting a fasta file into only one line of sequence per contig, chromosome, gene, etc... this is useful during file parsing in some pipelines
	-add in error messages for easier user use if a sequence is out of range
